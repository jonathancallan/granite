              <h2>Why is an audit important?</h2>
              <p>Consider, in an offline context, what it would be like if no one could find your place of business, that is what it is like today if your website cannot be found in search engines. Potentially valuable customers never
                even know you are there. It is not enough to be found for your business name as that only captures searchers that already know where you are.</p>

              <p>The first step to being found in search engines is to know where you stand today.</p>

              <p>We offer two audits that can help you establish the search engine strength of your website:</p>
