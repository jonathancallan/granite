              <h2>What is Pay Per Click?</h2>
              <p>Led by Google AdWords, it is the primary advertising model on search engines and their advertising networks. For most pay per click publishers, advertisers bid in an auction-style system to have their ads displayed based on certain key words
                or phrases that are relevant to their target market. Publishers will display an ad either when a search keyword matches the advertiser's keyword list, or when a content page displays content relevant to the keyword list. Most
                publishers differentiate between these paid links and natural content links by calling them sponsored links/ads.</p>

              <h3>Pay Per Click Management</h3>

              <p>While anyone can technically setup and manage their own Pay Per Click campaign on a search engine such as Google, it is very difficult to achieve the optimal return for that investment without employing the expertise of an expert that has
                years of experience in driving both impact and efficiency in your campaign. Our expert knowledge will ensure you achieve the optimum return for your online advertising investment.</p>

              <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>

              <p>Due to the bid-based model, the cost per click can vary significantly based on the level of competition for a particular keyword and the potential return in a particular industry. The critical element of any successful campaign is understanding
                the return that you can get for particular keywords.</p>
