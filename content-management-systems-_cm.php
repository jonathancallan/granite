              <h2>Giving YOU the tools to manage your website</h2>

              <p>Website owners must have a Content Management System (CMS) if they are serious about their digital business.</p>

              <p>A CMS is a software solution which will allow you edit and publish content to your website so you control what your customers see.</p>

              <p>At Granite Digital we have worked with many solutions over the years and we recommend the following:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>TeamworkCMS</li>
                <li>Wordpress CMS</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>TeamworkCMS</h3>

              <p>TeamworkCMS is a powerful Content Management Solution (CMS) that can manage the content of any website. You are not limited with the design you want to use. One of the best features is a component plug-in architecture that allows user to
                quickly plug-in features such as image galleries into any page on the website with just a few clicks.</p>

              <h3>Wordpress CMS</h3>

              <p>Lots of people think open source and Wordpress is the answer for their digital business. It&#39;s not in our opinion but we can offer expert advice and support on what are the best ways to utilise Wordpress for your business. A key focus
                for Granite is the ongoing security of your Wordpress site to ensure your sensitive business data and brand identity is maintained.</p>
