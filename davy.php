        <h2>The Brief</h2>
        <p>Our brief was to help identify Davy’s core audiences and develop a mobile-first best-in-class UX website which was creatively head-and-shoulders above their peers. The commercial goal of the site was to generate a measurable number of leads for the internal sales team to close – a KPI we were confident of reaching. The final solution is a beautiful, clean design with subtle page-scroll transitions that message directly to Davy’s target audience and deliver on its commercial goals. The site integrates perfectly with Davy’s CMS, ensuring internal teams are empowered to deliver on their digital acquisition strategies and other commercial KPI’s.</p>
