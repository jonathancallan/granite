                <p>The entire team at Granite hit the ground running with the redevelopment of www.mansionhouse.ie. Right from day one Rob focused his team in on our business objective and collectively they created an innovative solution that aligned with
                  our goals for growth. They spent time really listening to us, then created a solid strategy that included innovative ways to improve how we market ourselves digitally. Everything from concept, to design and development, project management
                  and evaluation exceeded our expectations, and the process was seamless. Work with them, you will not regret it.</p>
