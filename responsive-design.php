              <h2>Mobile First</h2>
              <p>With the website design industry ever changing, our Web development team are continually adapting to this changing landscape in the way they approach website design. Responsive Web design is a strategy of design in which the website responds
                automatically to the end user's behaviour and environment depending on the screen size, platform of use and orientation.</p>
              <p>Responsive design allows Web pages to adapt seamlessly to the screen that they are showing on without compromising functionality and aesthetics. Websites with responsive design are viewed the same no matter which device you are using and
                any movement the user makes. The information stays on the screen and the user does not have to scroll left and right to make the information for on the page.</p>
              <p>It is estimated that 25% of internet users only access the internet via a mobile device - smartphone or tablet. Desktop internet users are expected to grow from 1.4 billion in 2009 to <strong>1.6 billion</strong> in 2015 while mobile internet
                users are expected to grow from approximately 800 million to <strong>1.9 billion</strong> during the same period <em>(ComScore Survey)</em>.</p>
              <h3>Recommended by Google</h3>
              <p>Crucially, Google recommends that webmasters follow the industry best practice of using responsive Web design, namely serving the same HTML for all devices and only using CSS media queries to decide the rendering on each device.</p>

              <h2>Responsive Web Design Strategy</h2>
              <h3>Content Analysis</h3>
              <p>Content comes first! It is vital that content is structured for every page of the website. This allows the developer to start thinking about the site in a linear form, which is the way mobile version of your site will be. All content questionsshould
                ideally be answered at this stage.</p>
              <h3>Responsive Wireframe</h3>
              <p>Presenting content blocks identified during the previous Content Analysis stage in the form of a dynamic HTML wireframe. This allows the content to be viewed on multiple devices. The key is to keep it simple!!</p>
              <h3>Static Design</h3>
              <p>At this stage the Web development team will identify whether to start with the desktop or mobile static mock for each particular site. It is at this point that the client should focus on the layout, colour, style of images, etc. that they
                want for their website.</p>
              <h3>Design Prototype</h3>
              <p>This stage is about translating the visual language of the static mock to various devices. Dynamic HTML prototype of the design is created that can be tested on different devices i.e smartphones, tablets, desktops, etc.</p>
              <h3>Design Style Guide</h3>
              <p>A HTML digital style guide is developed to help our developers to identify the sizes, styles and colours of the main HTML elements of the website.</p>
              <h3>Development</h3>
              <p>Site is coded according to the static mocks, prototypes and digital style guide, and then integrated with the content management system (CMS).</p>
              <h3>Testing</h3>
              <p>Final website is tested by the development team in conjunction with the client.</p>
