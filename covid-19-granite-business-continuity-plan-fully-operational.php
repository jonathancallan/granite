          <h2>Decisive action</h2>
          <p>Yesterday Granite made the decision to mobilise our team to work from home. We have robust plans in place to ensure that we can continue to serve our customers and we welcome the measures announced by the Government in an effort to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus.</p>
          <p>Granite is well placed to be fully operational during this crisis, our multiple office locations in Ireland and other EU countries mean that everyday we work with colleagues in dispersed locations without a thought. This is now second nature to us and we have also shared some of the tools we use in the hope it may help you get your business operational faster if you are impacted by moving from your normal location to home.</p>
