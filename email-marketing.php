              <h2>What is Email Marketing?</h2>

              <p>Traditional mail can be costly and time consuming. It can also slow lead times and is difficult to measure. With Email Marketing you can interact with your customers in the most cost effective and environmentally friendly way. It also provides
                effective delivery and measurability. Although we will run your Email Marketing campaign for you, you will retain control as it is permission based.</p>

              <p>There are two main types of Email marketing.</p>

              <h3>1. Direct Mail</h3> Direct email involves sending a promotional message in the form of an email. For example, a special offer announcement.</p>

              <h3>2. Retention email/ e-newsletters</h3>
              <p>Retention emails usually take the form of regular emails known as newsletters. A newsletter may carry promotional messages or advertisements, but its main aim is to develop a long term impact and relationship with the receiver.</p>
