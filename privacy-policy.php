                addressed to support@granite.ie</p>
              <p>You may also use the above contact information if you think any information about you is inaccurate, incomplete, or if you want to change the sort of information about you that Granite Digital may have collected.</p>
              <p>You have the right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Commissioner if you are unhappy with how we are processing your Data.</p>
              <h3>Information we may collect from you</h3>
              <p>We only collect Data about you on the Site which you volunteer when you email us or by using our online Contact Us or other forms; or if you report a problem with our Site. When you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
                We also collect Data automatically when you navigate through our Site, as explained in our <a href="./cookie-policy.php">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
              <p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
              <p>Contact information (business name, business address, contact telephone number and email address) and your IP address, your browser type, and your referring URL</p>
              <h3>Lawfulness of Processing</h3>
              <p>There are six alternative ways in which the lawfulness of a specific case of processing of personal data may be established under the GDPR.</p>
              <p>It is Granite Digital’s policy to identify the appropriate basis for processing and to document it, in accordance with the regulation. The options are described in brief in the following sections.</p>
              <p>1. <strong>Consent</strong></p>
              <p>Unless it is necessary for a reason allowable in the GDPR, Granite Digital will always obtain explicit consent from a data subject to collect and process their data. Transparent information about our usage of their personal data will be
                provided to data subjects at the time that consent is obtained and their rights with regard to their data explained, such as the right to withdraw consent.</p>
              <p>2. <strong>Performance of a Contract</strong></p>
              <p>Where the personal data collected and processed are required to fulfil a contract with the data subject, explicit consent is not required. This will often be the case where the contract cannot be completed without the personal data in question
                e.g. a delivery cannot be made without an address to deliver to.</p>
              <p>3. <strong>Legal Obligation</strong></p>
              <p>If the personal data is required to be collected and processed in order to comply with the law, then explicit consent is not required. This may be the case for some data related to employment and taxation for example, and for many areas
                addressed by the public sector.</p>
              <p>4. <strong>Vital Interests of the Data Subject</strong></p>
              <p>In a case where the personal data are required to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, then this may be used as the lawful basis of the processing. Granite Digital will retain reasonable, documented
                evidence that this is the case, whenever this reason is used as the lawful basis of the processing of personal data.</p>
              <p>5. <strong>Task Carried Out in the Public Interest</strong></p>
              <p>Where Granite Digital needs to perform a task that it believes is in the public interest or as part of an official duty then the data subject’s consent will not be requested. The assessment of the public interest or official duty will be
                documented and made available as evidence where required.</p>
              <p>6.<strong> Legitimate Interests</strong></p>
              <p>If the processing of specific personal data is in the legitimate interests of Granite Digital and is judged not to affect the rights and freedoms of the data subject in a significant way, then this may be defined as the lawful reason for
                the processing. Again, the reasoning behind this view will be documented.</p>
